      <p>I currently live in Cleveland Oh, although I spent a good amount of time in Columbus, Ohio going to Columbus Stat Community College and transferring on to Ohio University to finish my Bachelor's in Visual Communications. 
        I learned the basics of coding back in 2011 and I am ready to dive into all aspects of coding now. I just recently became a mother and want to enhance my career path to better provide for my daughter.
